# Cat Adoption :cat:
A little personal game project made using vanilla js

## About
Play the game [here](https://laurenawilkinson.github.io/cat-adoption)!

The gameplay mechanics are very basic. Choose your cat, name them, then take care of them. Don't let their needs bars fall!

I made this game for two reasons. The first is that I love cats. The second is to put my JavaScript knowledge to the test by making something I'm passionate about. In the game I show my knowledge and understanding of DOM manipulation, loops, objects and ES6 features such as sets, string interpolations and arrow functions.

## Upcoming enhancements
- Passive currency and a shop system
- Sprites for sleeping / washing / playing / eating / petting
- Possibly an account system so you can come back to your cat
- More cats!
